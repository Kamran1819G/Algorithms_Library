# <b>Data Structure & Algorithms 📈</b>

<b>What is Data Structure?</b><br>
• A data structure is a way to store and organize data in memory in order to facilitate access and modifications.
<br>
<b>What is Algorithms?</b> <br>
• An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.

## <b> Characteristics of a Data Structure</b>

<b>Correctness</b> − Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.
</br>
<b>Time Complexity</b> − Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.
</br>
<b>Space Complexity</b> − Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.
